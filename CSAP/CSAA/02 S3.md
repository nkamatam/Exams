## S3
S3 provides developers and IT teams with Secure, durable, Highly scalable object storage. AWS S3 is easy to use with a simple web service interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the internet.
#### What is S3?
* S3 is a safe place to store your files. 
* It is an object store
* Data is spread across multiple devices and facilities

#### Basics of S3
* S3 is object based storage
* Files can be 0bytes to 5 TB
* There is unlimited storage
* Files are stored in buckets
* S3 bucket has a universal namespace, that means that the names have to be unique globally
*  A web address is created for every S3
* When you upload your file to S3, you will get a HTTP 200
* **S3 is object storage**
	* Key - Name of the file
	* Value - The content of the file
	* Version Id - version of the file
	* Meta Data about the file
	* Sub Resources
		* Access Control Lists
		* Torrent
#### Data Consistency Model for S3
* Read after write consistency for PUTS of the new objects [ *if you are writing a new file, then it can be read immediately*]
* Eventual consistency for PUTS and DELETES (can take time to propagate) [*If you are overwriting or deleting an EXISTING file, then it can be stale for a second or so*]
* *Guarantee for S3*:
	* Built for 99.99% availability
	* AWS guarantees 99.9% availability
	* AWS guarantees 99.999999999% durability for S3 information [*This means that if you are creating a file on S3 the probability of it not getting lost is 99.999999999%*]
	* *Features of S3*
		* Tiered Storage available
		* LifeCycle Management
		* Versioning
		* Encryption
		* MFA for Deletes
		* Secure your data by using ACLs and Bucket Policies
#### Storage Clasess
* S3 standard
	* 99.9% availability
	* 99.999999999% Durability
	* Stored Redundantly
		* Across multiple facilities
		* Across multiple devices
	* Designed to sustain the unavailability of two facilities concurrently
* S3 - IA
	* For data that is accessed less frequently
	* But requires rapid access when needed
	* Lower Fees than S3 but you are charged a retrieval fee
* S3 1-zone IA
	* For where you want low cost for infrequently accessed data
	* Do not require multiple AZs for this
* S3 - Intelligent Tiering
	* Designed to optimise costs by automatically to the most cost effective tier 
* S3 Glacier
	* Low cost storage class for data archiving
	* cheaper than on-prem solutions
	* Retrieve times configurable from few minutes from hours
* S3 Glacier Deep Archive
	* Lowest Cost offering
	* Retrieval time of ~ 12 hours is acceptable 
### Creating S3 Bucket
* Bucket names are unique
* You will have to choose the region for the bucket
* You can choose to enable Object level logging at the bucket level using "CloudTrail",
* You can choose to have the bucket encrypted.
